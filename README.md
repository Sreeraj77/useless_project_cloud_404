### Project Description
Pet Audio Translator is a totally fake but hilarious web app that ‚Äútranslates‚Äù your pet‚Äôs barks, meows, or moos into absurd, over-dramatic text. Upload any animal sound and watch it pretend to decode their deepest (and most ridiculous) thoughts.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
To talk with our pets but the communication is only one way.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We read any audio and we have given a dozen of translations about it..... so randomly any conversion is read by the user

### Project Demo
# Video
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oE-d_aNgurAS0B42uLIhRP45GQwzc26f
The video is demonstrating the working of our project that if we upload a pre recorded of any pet it may show any absurd translation which is completely not relevant.

# Additional Demos
[Add any extra demo materials/links]
